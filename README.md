# stego

Simple Steganography implementation in golang.

This app is created just for me to learn and understanding how steganography work using Least significant bit (lsb) in pixel image to store message.

I dont write it myself, some code may contain others code from this repo :

- [stego by EthanWelsh](https://github.com/EthanWelsh/Stego/tree/master)
- [steganography by Auyer](https://github.com/auyer/steganography)


```
Usage of stego:
  -d    Decode a message from a given image file
  -e    Encode a message to a given image file
  -h    Help
  -i string
        Path to the the input image
  -m string
        Path to the message input file
